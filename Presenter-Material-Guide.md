# AI Unlocked: Empowering Higher Ed through Research and Discovery  
## **Presenter Guide: Uploading Your Materials**  

Welcome to the **AI Unlocked Workshop Repository!** As a presenter, please follow these guidelines to upload your materials and make them accessible to participants.  

### **Recommended Folder Structure**  
We recommend organizing your session materials within your respective track folder:  
- **Beginner Track:** `track1-beginner/`
- **Intermediate to Advanced Track:** `track2-advanced/`

Each session can have its own subfolder with relevant materials. While presenters are free to organize their materials, we **recommend** the following structure for ease of navigation, it is **highly recommended** to include:  
- **Presentation slides** (`slides.pdf` or `.pptx`)  
- **Workshop notes or instructions** (`workshop-notes.md`)  
- **Code files** (`.py`, `.sh`, or other source files in a `code/` folder)  
- **Jupyter Notebooks** (`.ipynb` in a `notebooks/` folder)  
- **Setup instructions** (`setup-instructions.md`) for running materials on different resources (e.g., Delta, Expanse)  

You are free to structure your session materials in a way that best fits your content, but ensuring clarity and accessibility for participants is key.  

## Recommended Folder Structure

While presenters are free to organize their materials, we **recommend** the following structure for clarity:

## How to Use This Structure
- Keep files organized within your track and session.
- Use clear, meaningful filenames.
- Include setup instructions for hands-on exercises.


### **How to Upload Your Files**  
#### **Option 1: Upload via GitHub Web Interface**
1. Navigate to your track folder and session subfolder.  
2. Click `Add file > Upload files`.  
3. Drag and drop your files or select them from your system.  
4. Click `Commit changes`.  

#### **Option 2: Upload via Git (Recommended for multiple files)**
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/access-ci-org/AI-Unlocked-Workshop-2025.git
   cd AI-Unlocked-Workshop-2025
2. Navigate to your session folder and copy your materials there.
3. Add and commit your files:
   ```bash
   git add track1-beginner/intro-to-ai/*
   git commit -m "Added workshop materials for Intro to AI"
   git push origin main

#### **Important Guidelines

Ensure your materials are easy to navigate – well-named files help participants find what they need quickly.

Provide setup instructions for running your content, particularly if it requires a specific environment.

Include backup materials (PDFs, notebooks, and code) in case of network issues.

Use Markdown (.md) files where possible for clarity and easy readability.
