# Workflows and AI - Workshop Notes

All material for this session is already deployed in the ACCESS Pegasus
environment. Please log in with your browser:

https://pegasus.access-ci.org

Once logged in, start a Jupyter Notebook. 2 hours lifetime should be
enough.

Once inside the Jupyter Notebook, you will find a directory named
`ACCESS-Pegasus-Examples`. In that directory you will find the 
tutorial chapters, numbered `01-` to `05-`. In this workshop, we will
cover `01`, `03`, and `04`.

The material is a permanent feature of ACCESS Pegasus - you may come
back at any time and revisit or explore the chapters not covered
during the workshop.
