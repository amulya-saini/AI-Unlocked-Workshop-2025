Reservation: nairrworkshop (this reservation can be used only from April 2, 9AM – April 3, 1:30PM), any other time leave blank\
QOS (GPU jobs only): gpu-shared-eot\
QOS (compute partition): normal-eot (for short batch jobs only)\

Tips for EXPANASE:  
\- Use 'shared' for all CPU-only interactive jobs.  
\- Use 'gpu-shared' + 'gpu-shared-eot' QOS for GPU jobs. Prefer short batch jobs due to limited GPU availability.  
\- Only use 'compute' partition with 'normal-eot' QOS for special short batch needs.
